# Lunch Bytes November 2019 RSMAS: Exploring the features of Overleaf Latex Editor
---------------------------------
We will explore the use of the online Latex editor: Overleaf. Whether you already use Latex for writing, curious about starting, or searching for an easier to use latex editor, Overleaf is a great tool for academic writing. Some of the features we will explore include: Getting set up on Overleaf, Free Vs. Paid versions (and student pricing), Mendeley and Github Integration, finding and using major journal templates, Journal Direct Submissions,  and sharing/collaborating on projects directly in the editor.
